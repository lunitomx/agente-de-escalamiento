# Story Close

## Purpose

Close a story in ONE composite call. The deterministic ritual (retro gate,
hygiene, 3-tier merge-target resolution, --no-ff merge, branch cleanup,
worktree restore, Done transition) runs in `raise-cli` — this skill keeps
only the judgment gates (ADR-093 / ADR-024).

## Steps

### Pipeline Context Check (RAISE-10715)

Before executing any step, verify this skill was invoked via the pipeline engine:

1. Check if `Run ID:` appears in the context above (injected by `pipeline/prompt.py`)
2. If **present**: continue silently — pipeline is orchestrating
3. If **absent**: **STOP and present HITL gate:**

> **Standalone execution detected.** This skill is running outside the pipeline engine.
> Prior phases (implement, quality review, architecture review) may have been skipped.
>
> Options:
> 1. Continue anyway (acknowledge that prior phases were skipped)
> 2. Abort and investigate why the pipeline engine is not orchestrating

Wait for the user's explicit choice before proceeding. This gate fires even in Ri mode — standalone execution is a signal of broken infrastructure, not a routine gate.

### Step 1: Judgment gates (before the call)

These need human/LLM criteria — they are NOT absorbed by the tool:

1. **Story-close gates** — `rai gate check --point before:story:close`.
   Do not use `rai gate check --all` here: `--all` includes release/publish
   gates such as coverage, eval, full tests, and integration checks that are
   intentionally too broad for story close on a busy developer runner.
   If implement/complete already ran on this commit, trust its scoped
   tests/lint/format/types evidence for code quality; story close validates
   close-specific governance only.
2. **AR gate** — verification only. The P1 drift / P2 Beck-R2 / P3 convention
   checklist runs in `/rai-story-review`, which writes the session-scoped
   attestation marker as its output. Close never creates or removes that
   marker itself — attesting and verifying in the same command let the gate
   pass unconditionally (RAISE-14277 / ADR-130: attestation and verification
   must not be the same actor at the same instant). This step only checks:
   ```bash
   rai gate check gate-ar-story
   ```
   Escape hatch (XS/docs):
   ```bash
   RAISE_AR_SKIP_REASON="<reason>" rai gate check gate-ar-story
   ```

### Step 2: Close (one call)

Use the `raise_story_close_full` MCP tool with story_id="S{N}.{M}",
slug="{story-slug}", epic_dir="e{N}-{name}", jira_key="{KEY}",
merge_summary="S{N}.{M}: {name} — {1-line}", cwd="{worktree_path}".

CLI fallback (ADR-084): `rai story close --story-id S{N}.{M} --slug {slug}
--epic-dir e{N}-{name} --jira-key {KEY} --summary "..." -f json`

Merge target resolves worktree DB → `worktree-e{N}*` branch → dev branch.
Telemetry is emitted server-side — do NOT emit signals from the skill.

### Step 3: Handle the report

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `status: ok` | Continue to Step 4 |
| `retro: blocked` | **STOP** — run `/rai-story-review` first, no exceptions |
| `hygiene: blocked` (staged orphans) | **STOP** — present `discard / stash / keep`; never auto-resolve |
| `merge: blocked` (`merge-conflict`) | Merge was aborted, repo is clean. Resolve on story branch, retry |
| `backlog: blocked` (multiple candidates) | Present candidates, ask which means "done" |
| `backlog: blocked` (transition failed / fixVersion failed) | **STOP** — Jira must not diverge from git; fix the sync and retry |
| `cleanup/restore: warn` | Mention; fix manually if needed |

> **Jira-sync enforcement (RAISE-10966)** for story close lives in tested code,
> not this skill text: `raise-cli`'s `transition_backlog(kind="done")` blocks on
> a failed Done transition and assigns `fixVersion` = active release. A `backlog:
> blocked` report means that invariant tripped — do not log-and-continue.

### Step 4: Epic scope update (judgment)

Mark the story complete in `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/scope.md` (checkbox +
progress table) and commit on the merge target.

> **Standalone story only** (epic_dir vacío): verifica que el worktree refleje
> el workitem correcto tras el cierre:
> ```bash
> rai worktree list   # confirmar workitem_id y status del worktree activo
> ```
> (El comando mission accomplish fue eliminado en ADR-130 — el binding vive en
> `worktrees.workitem_id`; no existe concepto de "objetivos de misión".)
> En stories dentro de una épica, esto se hace en `/rai-epic-close` Step 5.

### Step 5: Present

```
## Story S{N}.{M} closed
**Merged:** {branch} → {target} @ {sha} ({tier})
**Jira:** {KEY} → {transitioned} · **Cleanup:** {deleted}
```

**STOP HERE.** Return your summary to the orchestrator.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Gates + AR review BEFORE the composite call
- [ ] `blocked` always escalates with options verbatim
- [ ] Epic worktree never left on the dev branch (tool restores it)
